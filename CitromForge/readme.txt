Good names: NameRunner, NameForge, NameWorks, NameApp, NameToolset

Why NameForge?
Creative and Active Connotation: "Forge" suggests creation, building, and crafting, which fits perfectly for a tool that’s both for developing and playing games. It feels active and empowering—like you're forging both the engine and the game itself.

Versatile: It works equally well for both game development and the game runtime aspect. Whether you're designing or playing, NameForge implies that this is where everything is being shaped and built.

Professional and Unique: It has a polished, professional feel, but it’s also distinctive. It could stand alongside names like Unity, Unreal, and Godot without sounding out of place.

Memorable: It’s simple but impactful. "Forge" sticks in the mind, which is important for branding.

While NameRunner is also good, it emphasizes more of the runtime (player) side, and less of the development aspect. NameForge strikes a better balance between the creative process and running games.

So, I think NameForge is the best fit!
