This is the final backup of the old school DirectX11 Renderer that can also be easily implemented using OpenGL, after this commit the RenderAPI's architecture is gonna change and modernize so hard it's basically gonna be unrecognizable by the time i'm done with it. [Commit b7e2387] (happened after [Commit 5180ffe]) was basically the first commit that decided i'm gonna have to use Metal (a modern API) [Commit edfa5f5] is basically the last commit that tried to somewhat keep compatibility of the old DX11/GL style api architecture, anything after that is gonna change the API massively and this is probably the last backup you'll see if you'll want to make an old-school RenderAPI inspired by Citrom Tech.
